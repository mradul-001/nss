b) In Django, a view is a Python function or class that receives an HTTP request and returns an HTTP response. 
Views contain the business logic of the application and are responsible for processing data, interacting with the database, and rendering templates. 
On the other hand, a template is an HTML file that defines the structure and layout of the final web page. Templates are typically used within 
views to dynamically generate HTML content by combining static HTML with data passed from the view. In essence, views handle the application logic,
while templates handle the presentation layer by defining how the data should be displayed to the user.
