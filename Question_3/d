In Dart, private variables can be created by prefixing their names with an underscore (`_`). These variables are accessible only within the library or class in which they are declared, ensuring encapsulation and data integrity. 
  By using private variables, developers can restrict direct access to internal implementation details, promoting better code organization and maintenance. 
Access to private variables from outside the defining class or library is prevented, thereby enhancing code security and reducing the likelihood of unintended modifications or dependencies on internal implementations.
